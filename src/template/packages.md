The Matdash Vue.js Admin Template includes several subfolders in its package, each serving specific purposes to support different layout styles, themes, and configurations. Here’s an explanation of the subfolders:
	•	dark: This folder contains files and configurations for the dark theme of the admin template. It allows users to switch to a dark mode interface by applying specific CSS and JavaScript settings.
	•	default: This folder holds the standard layout and theme files for the admin template. It represents the basic configuration without additional modifications like dark mode or RTL (Right-to-Left) support.
	•	horizontal: This folder is designed for a horizontal navigation layout, where the menu bar is positioned at the top of the page instead of the sidebar.
	•	main: The main folder includes core files for the template, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS files. It serves as the base structure for all other variations.
	•	minisidebar: This folder contains configurations for a compact sidebar layout. The sidebar is minimized to save screen space while still providing access to navigation links.
	•	rtl: This folder supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages like Arabic or Hebrew. It includes specific styles and configurations to render the interface correctly for RTL text direction.
	•	starterkit: The starter kit folder provides a minimal setup with essential files to help developers quickly begin customizing the template without unnecessary overhead.
Each of these folders is tailored to meet different design preferences and functional requirements, making the Matdash Vue.js Admin Template highly versatile and customizable.
